<!-- start-intro -->

TensorFlow NUFFT is a fast, native non-uniform fast Fourier transform op for
TensorFlow. It provides:

- Fast CPU/GPU kernels. The TensorFlow framework automatically handles device
  placement as usual.
- A simple, well-documented Python interface.
- Gradient definitions for automatic differentiation.
- Shape functions to support static shape inference.

The underlying algorithm is based on the NUFFT implementation by the Flatiron
Institute. Please refer to
[FINUFFT](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft/) and
[cuFINUFFT](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/cufinufft/) for more details.

## Installation

You can install TensorFlow NUFFT with ``pip``:

```
pip install tensorflow-nufft
```

Note that only Linux wheels are currently being provided.

### TensorFlow compatibility

Each TensorFlow NUFFT release is compiled against a specific version of
TensorFlow. To ensure compatibility, it is recommended to install matching
versions of TensorFlow and TensorFlow NUFFT according to the table below.

## Usage

Once installed, you can perform NUFFTs in your TensorFlow code simply as:

```python
import tensorflow_nufft as tfft

outputs = tfft.nufft(inputs, points)
```

See the documentation for the
[`tfft.nufft`](https://mrphys.github.io/tensorflow-nufft/api_docs/tfft/nufft)
function to learn more about the different parameters.
